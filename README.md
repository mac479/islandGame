# islandGame
A small game to generate a random island and let the player explore it. In the file world.png it shows a map of a previously generated world, each pixel representing one block where darkened blocks represent blocks that exist in the background layer. Within the map ore viens and caves also randomly generate to make the world feel more natural. Furthermoore, the red line represents the boundray of the world, the generation algorithm takes care to match the end and start of the map to make the world seem infinite.

* Bugs: The current lighting is not fully implemented and does not display shadows current. A program within the src file called lighting test shows a demo of the lighting algorithm and how it is supposed to work.

Note: This project is one I have spent years working on and as a result bear a good deal of attachment to it.
However that also means in this project there is code from when I just learned basic java. What is written in
here can be at times horrifying to look at and read over. I am sorry for what I have created but all I can do
now is hopefully try to rework it in the future.
