# islandGame
A small game to generate a random island and let the player explore it

Note: This project is one I have spent years working on and as a result bear a good deal of attachment to it.
However that also means in this project there is code from when I just learned basic java. What is written in
here can be at times horrifying to look at and read over. I am sorry for what I have created but all I can do
now is hopefully try to rework it in the future.
